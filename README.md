# Play with LLMs

This is a repo to store and record my research and experiment regarding LLMs (both open and closed, local and remote).

Starting with Bing Chat (Microsoft Copilot), I've done few topics:

- [Content generating: world settings](./world-settings/) 2023-02
- [Content manipulation: tables](./table-manipulation/) 2023-02
- [Coding](./coding/) 2023-02
- [Play with llms apps](./2024-10-play-with-llm-apps/README.md) 2024-10
- [Local LLMs](./local-llms//README.md) 2024-11
