# Play with LLMs

This is a repo to store and record my research and experiment regarding LLMs (both open and closed, local and remote).

Starting with Bing Chat (Microsoft Copilot), I've done few topics:


- [Content generating: world settings](./experiments/2023-02-online-services/world-settings/)
- [Content manipulation: tables](./experiments/2023-02-online-services/table-manipulation/)
- [Coding](./experiments/2023-02-online-services/coding/)
- [Play with llms apps](./experiments/2024-10-play-with-llm-apps/README.md)
- [Local LLMs](./experiments/2024-11-local-llms-evaluation/README.md)
