* **Combine Categories:** Mix and match keywords from different categories (e.g., "1girl, loli, pink hair, twin tails, sailor fuku, eating ice cream, park, daytime, soft lighting, close-up").
* **Use Negative Prompts:** If your platform supports it, use negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements (e.g., `negative prompt: ugly, deformed, blurry, bad anatomy`).
* **Weight Keywords:** Some platforms allow you to emphasize certain keywords using parentheses or numbers (e.g., `(masterpiece:1.2), beautiful detailed eyes`).
* **Iterate:** Image generation is often a process of trial and error. Don't be afraid to try different combinations and adjust your prompts.
* **Consider Artist Styles:** Adding artist names or specific art styles can significantly influence the output.
